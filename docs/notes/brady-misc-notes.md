## Pedestrian volumes (observed)

### 4th street

These are volumes per hour in the given intervals. So not cumulative. So the first row is 7people/hour. 

|Interval|Volume|
|---|---|
|15:45|7|
|14:00|6|
|13:00|3|
|11:45|2|

### Mesa Street

Raw counts

|Peak duration|Total pedestrians|PPH|Start time|
|---|---|---|---|
|1-hour|6|6|2/19/2025 16:00|
|2-hour|6|3|2/19/2025 14:45|
|3-hour|7|2.3|2/19/2025 13:30|

Scaled for seasonality (factor of 1.9)

|Peak duration|Total pedestrians (adjusted)|PPH (adjusted)|Start time|

## Adjusting pedestrian volumes to annual units

The SGM mesa analysis has a reference on how to do this. I will be following it step by step using the given unadjusted AND adjusted pedestrian volumes.

The adjusted counts come from scaling the feb counts to may using the seasonal scalars and taking the average of the "Long winter" and "Moderate Climate" factors. So:

$$
6 \cdot \frac{\frac{1}{2} (0.11 + 0.08)}{\frac{1}{2} (0.03 + 0.07)} \\
= 6 \cdot \frac{0.095}{0.05} \\
= 6 \cdot 1.9 \\
= 11.4
$$

2/19/2025 was a thursday, so I'll use the weekday scaling. 

### Step 1. Scale hourly peak up

Multiply these counts by 1.05

- **Unadjusted:** 6 * 1.05 = 6.3 hourly users
- **Adjusted:** 11.4 * 1.05 = 11.97 hourly users

This scaling is done to adjust for pedestrians who use the intersection between 11pm and 6am. 

### Step 2. Calculate daily total

Use table 1 on page 12. Multi use path, october-march table at 1400. Gives 9%. 

- **Unadjusted:** 6.3 / 0.09 = 70 daily users
- **Adjusted:** 11.97 / 0.09 = 133 daily users

## Step 3. Calculate weekly volumes

Divide the daily counts by the daily adjustment factors. Thursday has a factor of 12%.

- **Unadjusted:** 70 / 0.12 = 583.33 weekly users
- **Adjusted:** 133 / 0.12 = 1108.33 weekly users

### Step 4. Convert to monthly volumes

Multiply weekly volume by average number of weeks in a month (4.33).

- **Unadjusted:** 583.33 * 4.33 = 2525.82 monthly users (Feb)
- **Adjusted:** 1108.33 * 4.33 = 4797.64 monthly users (Scaled to May)

### Step 5. Convert to annual totals

Divide the monthly volume by the month factor in table 3. SGM used the average of the long winter and moderate climate scalars. 

For Feb I'll take the average of the climate regions to be consistent with SGM. So I will divide by 0.05. For the adjusted I'll take the average of the May values. So 0.095.

- **Unadjusted:** 2525.82 / 0.05 = 50514.4 annual users
- **Adjusted:** 4797.64 / 0.095 = 50501.4 annual users.

Both values end up at around 50.5 thousand pedestrians per year. 

**NOTE** that this difference is due to rounding. Performing these calculations programmatically results in both reaching an expected annual volume of **50,516.67** pedestrians.
