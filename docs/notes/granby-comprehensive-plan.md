Recently I found Granby's comprehensive 15 year plan. It details multiple challenges facing the town and their plans to resolve this stuff. This document in general is amazing and 144 pages long! 

Not all of this will be related to the rec center project, but are nice to know for developing a better overall context of the town itself. 

Below are my notes on this document.

## Community Context

### Key issues facing the town

High cost of limited housing, dangerous roads due to traffic volume on roads not designed for it and a limited public transit system being key issues. These are all things the town has detailed plans to tackle. 

### Demographic Info

- Approximate population of 2235 as of 2021. 
- About half the homes in Granby are owned by second home or seasonal homeowners. So, people that are super wealthy basically. 
- Granby also has an older population on average, with a median age of 42 compared to Colorado's overall median of 38. 
- Median household income of $75k, below Colorado's median of $77k.

### Employment Info

- Granby has a high ratio of jobs to households. 
- Large amounts of retail and restauraunt sectors. Unsurprising for a tourism town. 
- Grand County Schools and Middle Park Electric provide much of the employment opportunities in the town.

### Community Health and Quality of Life

- Granby lacks high speed internet access. 
- Community enjoys good access to health care due to its proximity to the local hospital.
- Granby sees higher risk of unhealthy air, likely due to wildfire risk
- Strong civic engagement in the town
- Granby has a lot of good community gathering spaces.

### Multimodal transportation

- Increased traffic on US 40 that passes through town is dangerous and screws with local traffic and pedestrian/biking activity.
- Lack of trail connections from outlying neighborhoods. 
- Opportunities for redesigns on downtown Granby to be safer and more walkable. 
- There is a huge need for enhanced transit between grand county towns. Issues of people being stranded by the Amtrak train for example. 

### Parks and Open Space

Okay this one is very relevant to our project.

- Granby hosts a lot of local events throughout the year.
- School gyms and playgrounds help supplement facilities made by the town.
- Town has **limited staff** to provide recreational programs and maintain parks in town.
    - This is definitely something to consider for a rec center.
- Town lacks trails and sidewalks that connect the various parks and towns.
    - Improvements here could provide additional traffic to the rec center!

## Community Vision

From a survey provided to the towns residents, here are the top 4 responses to the following question: **Please select the top FOUR values that should guide the vision for Granby's future**.

1. Family focused / community minded
2. Retaining a small town feel
3. A community focused on recreational opportunities
4. A community that recruits new businesses and expands workforce opportunities.

Below is an exerpt from the community vision on quality of life. 

> Granby continues to develop parks and recreation facilities and amenities that serve the needs of families, single persons, and residents of all ages and provides safe routes for walking and biking between different neighborhoods and districts in the community.

# Future Land Use and Development

Of relevance here is the **institutional** category for land use. 

> This land use category included publicly-owned properties that are used for community-wide uses. 

Examples include
- Granby Airport
- School campus
- Town Hall
- Water treatment plant

I would ASSUME this would include a rec center owned by the town as well. 

# Parks and Open Space

Town of granby has four key parks.
- Kaibab Park
    - Potential location for the new rec center (southeast of it)
- Polhamus Park
    - Plan is to have it keep its open feel and function as an event space for community events. 
    - Potential plan for a band shell to host live music performances?????
- Raffety Park
    - Plan is to have it continue to operate as a landscaped park for the nearby school. 
- Morales Park
    - Neighborhood park, small and simple. 

Granby is highly valued for its outdoor recreational options. This town has some demand for additional activities too, such as water-based ones like swimming. The Fraser River is public and can be used for kayaking, but the LAND along much of it is privately owned, limiting access to the river. Plans are in motion to work on that. 

This offers a unique niche for a rec CENTER to fill, as it can accommodate physical activities harder to do outside/in the winter. Facilities such as swimming, weight lifting and others are best kept indoors for year-round access in a cold mountain town. 

Speaking of the rec center, this document has this to say about it w/ regards to Kaibab park.

> The conceptual plan for Kaibab park also identifies a potential trail connection under Highway 40 to the east, to provide for an eventual extension of trails along the Fraser River to the east. This trail would also connect to a town-owned parcel identified for recreational uses, along the east side of Highway 40 and to the south of the Fraser River. The comprehensive plan identifies this parcel **as a potential location for the development of a recreation center for the Granby community**. (page 96)

For survey responses to the question: **What THREE types of park and recreation features, that Granby currently does NOT have, would you like to see developed in the future?**

1. Swimming pools
2. Ice arena
3. Gymnasium

Parks and open space Goal 3: Plan for future parks, recreational facilities, and civic spaces as different areas of Granby grow. 

POS action 10: Explore the creation of an indoor recreation or civic center facility for the Granby community. 

# Community Facilities and Services

Interesting note here.

> Although the town has an inventory and mapping of much of the existing utility infrastructure, it has not implemented a GIS-based system to better organize and make this data available. 

# Implementation Plan

    - Type of action/project: New projects
    - Potential partners with the town: GOCO funding (great outdoors colorado)
    - Order of magnitude cost (to the town): $$$
    - Priority: High
    - Project length: Short term (1-3 years)
