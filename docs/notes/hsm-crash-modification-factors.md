## Definitions

A **Crash Modification Factor** (CMF) is a value that quantifies the expected change in crash frequency at a site as a result of implementing a specific countermeasure.

**Countermeasure:** Countermeasures can also be called “treatments” or “safety treatments”. Traffic signals, bulbouts, roundabouts, etc. 

## Mathematical definition

$$
\text{CMF} = \frac{\text{Expected crash frequency with treatment}}{\text{Expected crash frequency without treatment}}
$$

From this, a CMF above 1 is expected to increase crash frequency. A CMF below 1 is expected to reduce crash frequency. CMF of 1 indicates no expected change. Lower bound of 0. 

## Crash modification function

CMFs can be calculated for specific sites with specific characteristics. This is called a **Crash modification function** which calculates the **crash modification factor** given certain parameters. 

## Use cases

CMFs can be used to:

- Compare safety gains across traffic measures.
- Compare safety gains across locations.
- Check reasonableness by comparing against existing CMFs.
- Check validity of assumptions in cost-benefit analysis.

This can even be used to compare safety gains given cost. Like, for example, the CMF per dollar. 

## Standard error

CMFs, being randon variables, have standard error. This is documented in the HSM. 

## CMF per type of crash

A CMF may be different across different kinds of accidents. Like, a signal may show a reduction in right-turn accidents (CMF < 1) but an increase in read-endings (CMF > 1). 

So correctly using CMFs depends on the type of accidents that are relevant to the given situation. 

## Multiple treatments

Common practice is to multiply the two treatment CMFs together. So for a project with a bulbout and a light, you would combine the two. 

**WARNING:** This statement assumes the treatments are at the same location with the same conditions.
