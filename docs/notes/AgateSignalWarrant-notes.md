# Overview

This file contains the various notes I've taken on the agate signal warrant report. 

## Understanding the tables

These notes will not be in depth as there are many times variable types and jargon that would be an unwise use of time on such a short time frame project. 

### Synchro figure to table mapping

There are a variety of visualizations of traffic flows that can be found at the end of the report. These values are pulled from various tables from earlier in the report, but they can be awkward to find. 

All of these tables are TWSC (two way stop controlled), so no signals.
