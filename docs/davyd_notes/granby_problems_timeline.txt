2019 — A previous study by a different firm (Bowman Consulting) found that 6th Street already warranted a signal back then, but nobody did anything because of the County Road 60 problem right next to it
2022 — A new development called Granby Market Square was proposed north of town, which would bring more traffic to the area, making the problem worse
Late 2024 — SGM and the Town of Granby got serious about it. SGM sent CDOT a methodology memo in December 2024 basically saying "here's how we plan to do this study, do you approve?"
November 25, 2024 — There was an actual Zoom/Google Meet call between SGM, the Town of Granby, and CDOT Region 3 to align on the approach
December 2024 — CDOT responded with comments and conditions but gave the green light
February 2025 — SGM went out and actually counted traffic at the intersections
May 2025 — SGM submitted the draft study to CDOT for review
June 2025 — Final signed report delivered

What did CDOT push back on?
CDOT came back with several comments before approving the methodology, things like:

Show your math on how you calculated the traffic volume factors
Include ALL 8 warrants in the report, even if just to say "not applicable"
Adjust volumes for seasonal variation (February is slow, July is peak)
Originally CDOT wanted a 20-year future analysis (to 2045), but SGM pushed back and said 2030 is more relevant for a signal warrant study — and CDOT agreed

The 6th Street problem existed before Granby Market Square - the 2019 study already flagged it as warranting a signal. So the underlying traffic issue was already real. Granby Market Square
just poured gasoline on it. It's a new development that would bring more cars into that exact area, making an already-bad intersection worse. So think of GMS as the thing that
finally forced the Town's hand — "we can't keep kicking this down the road, it's about to get a lot busier."

The report doesn't go into detail about what specifically triggered the 2019 Bowman study. It just references it
as background. But based on context, it was likely the Town noticing the 6th Street intersection was already getting
congested and wanting to know if a signal was justified. That study said that yes, 6th Street warranted a signal, but then
nothing happened because of the County Road 60 complexity and cost. So it just sat on a shelf for a few years.
