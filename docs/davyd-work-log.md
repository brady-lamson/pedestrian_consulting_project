    - Had initial call with Chris Michalowski at 10:00am. Had recap with Brady after the call.
    - Chris sent documents related to the project shortly after the call.

    - Met with Brady in person 2:00-5:00pm.
    - Initial look at the two documents Chris had sent over last week. These were the SGM engineering form report and the CDOT report.
    - Understood the relevant geography and streets by reading the documents and looking up streets in maps. Agate St is what highway 40 becomes once it enters downtown Granby. 4th, 5th, 6th, and Mesa St intersect Agate from the north.
    - Understood the motivations for each report. CDOT document was centered more on vehicle congenstion in 4th-6th street. SGM report was focused on implementing potential safety measures around the Agate and Mesa intersection, which is close to the Granby schools.
    - Understood the basic premise of simulation modeling done in the CDOT document (Synchro and SimTraffic). Initial vehicle flow rate parameters are observed from real life, and are then inputed into simulation software to determine other important values like the average wait time for a vehicle at an intersection. Looked into some underlying math of the program and realized its baed on concepts I had covered in my Probabilistic Modeling class from Fall 2024. Things like M/M/1 queues, Poisson arrival times, and exponential gaps between arrivals.
    - created my work log (davyd-work-log.md) and also a folder for notes that I will take like my statistical concepts document, and other isolated topics I summarize as I go. I decided that the notes will be in the form of pdf documents that I will create in google docs and then upload to the github repo. This will make it easier to format and add screenshots.
