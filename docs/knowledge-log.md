    - Learned: Last year was one of Grand County's deadliest with regards to traffic fatalities. Of the 45 deaths that have occurred from 2015-2025, 11 of them were in 2025 alone. One of the biggest reasons was a lack of seatbelts. According to [2], victims were unbelted in half of these cases.  Other reasons for these deaths include extreme speeding, illegal lane changes and dangerous passing behavior. These are particularly dangerous on the long, narrow winding rows present in the county. These roads also get way busier than they were ever intended to become in ski season. Law enforcement enacted a zero-tolerance policy on traffic violations back in August in response to this. Alongside this are a ton of different plans and proposed legislation.

    - Open questions: Though I found a lot of information related to fatal traffic accidents, I found nothing about pedestrian fatalities. What am I missing here?
