    - Learned: 
        - Granby is a small town of around 2200 people on only 12.7 square miles of land. (page 20)
        - Its population skews slightly older than Colorado overall with a median age of 42 vs. Colorado's 38. Popular retirement location. (page 21)
        - About half the housing units in Granby are owned by second home or seasonal homeowners. These homes are classified as vacant. (page 20)
        - Median household income $75k, slightly below Colorado median of $77k. (page 21)
        - Though Granby is known for its incredible outdoor recreational options, there is a demand for an indoor rec center that accommodates activities harder to do outdoors. (page 98)
            - Swimming, gymnasiums, etc.
        - The town has limited staff for recreational programs and park maintenance. (page 23)
        - A possible location for said rec center would be south-east of Kaibab park. (pages 95-96)
        - This is a **HIGH PRIORITY** project with a planned project length of around 1-3 years. (Page 132)
        - Possible funding from Great Outdoors Colorado (GOCO)? (page 132)

    - Learned: Last year was one of Grand County's deadliest with regards to traffic fatalities. Of the 45 deaths that have occurred from 2015-2025, 11 of them were in 2025 alone. One of the biggest reasons was a lack of seatbelts. According to [2], victims were unbelted in half of these cases.  Other reasons for these deaths include extreme speeding, illegal lane changes and dangerous passing behavior. These are particularly dangerous on the long, narrow winding rows present in the county. These roads also get way busier than they were ever intended to become in ski season. Law enforcement enacted a zero-tolerance policy on traffic violations back in August in response to this. Alongside this are a ton of different plans and proposed legislation.

    - Open questions: Though I found a lot of information related to fatal traffic accidents, I found nothing about pedestrian fatalities. What am I missing here?
